#+TITLE:Org-Tracker

Simple, unopinionated integration between Emacs's [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] and multiple issue
trackers

This project is a work-in-progress fork of [[https://github.com/glittershark/org-clubhouse][org-clubhouse]] to support pluggable
backends, starting with JIRA

* Installation

Org-tracker allows configuring multiple backends, and using different backends
for different org files. At a high level, configuration consists of adding a
backend object as a key of ~org-tracker-backends~, then configuring that backend
either as ~org-tracker-default-backend~ or per-file via the ~#+TRACKER_BACKEND~
buffer setting.

** JIRA

First, generate an API token by logging into your JIRA instance and going to the
"API tokens" page under account settings, located at
https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens for atlassian cloud.
Then, add something like this to your emacs config:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setf
 (alist-get 'work-jira org-tracker-backends)
 (make-instance 'org-tracker-jira-backend
                :url "https://your-team-name.atlassian.net"
                :auth 'token
                :user-login-name "your-email@example.com"
                :token "jira-api-token"))
#+end_src

You can then either configure this as the default backend for all org files:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-tracker-default-backend 'work-jira)
#+end_src

Or set this as the backend for a particular org-mode file by adding the
following line to the top of the file:

#+begin_src org
#+TRACKER_BACKEND: readyset-jira
#+end_src
